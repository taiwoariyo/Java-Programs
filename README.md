Java Programs Collection


Welcome to my collection of simple Java programs! This repository contains a series of independent Java programs I’ve created to explore and practice various Java concepts. These programs are standalone examples, each demonstrating different features or algorithms in Java.


Contents

This repository contains 14 Java programs, each showcasing different aspects of the Java programming language. These programs are designed for learners and developers who want to explore Java through practical examples.


List of Programs

1.	Program Ariyo_2a – The program simulates 100-coin tosses with a method and displays the simulation output.
   
2.	Program Ariyo_2b - The program simulates 100-coin tosses without a method and displays the simulation output.
   
3.	Program Ariyo_3a – The program reverses the given integer with a method and displays the result.
   
4.	Program Ariyo_3b - The program reverses the given integer without a method and displays the result.
   
5.	Program Ariyo_61 – The program displays data containing the medical records of a patient (Initialized with sample data).
    
6.	Program Ariyo_62 - The program displays data containing employee records of three employees (Initialized with sample data).
    
7.	Program Ariyo_P1 – The program computes the weight of an object by prompting the user to input the mass.
    
8.	Program Ariyo_P1a – The program computes the total number of bugs collected in 7 consecutive days by prompting the user to enter the daily number (using a while loop).
    
9.	Program Ariyo_P1b - The program computes the total number of bugs collected in 7 consecutive days by prompting the user to enter the daily number (using a for loop).
    
10.	Program Ariyo_P2 – The program computes the total income from ticket sales in a stadium by prompting the user to enter the class of the ticket and the number of tickets sold.
    
11.	Program Ariyo_P2a – The program computes the total rise in ocean levels for 20 years using a for loop (Initialized with a fixed yearly rise).
    
12.	Program Ariyo_P2b - The program computes the total rise in ocean levels for 20 years using a while loop (Initialized with a fixed yearly rise).
    
13.	Program Ariyo_P3 – The program computes and displays the projected tuition amount increase for eight consecutive years.
    
14.	Program Ariyo_P4 – The program computes the factorial of a non-negative integer and displays the result.
    
    
Prerequisites

To run any of the programs, you will need:

•	Java JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Java website.

•	A basic understanding of Java programming (each program is simple, but familiarity with Java syntax is recommended).

•	I created each program using Apache NetBeans.
